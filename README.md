# A boat with useReducer
[![Status overview badge](../../blob/badges/.github/badges/main/badge.svg)](#-results)


I want you to create a boat interface using `useReducer`.
You don't need to make many different components, but your UI should have the following elements:

- "Start engine" button
    - When the button is clicked, the engine status text should display "engine on".
- "Gear up" button
    - When the button is clicked, and the engine is started, the current gear text should increment by 1 (max 5).
- "Gear down" button
    - When the "Gear down" button is clicked, and the engine is started, the current gear text should decrement by 1 (min -2).
-  "Accelerate" button
    - When the "Accelerate" button is clicked, and the engine is started and in a non-zero gear, the speed text should increment according to the current gear.


Your reducer function should be able to do the following actions:

- start the boat engine
- stop the boat engine
    - also resets gear to 0
    - does not change the boat speed
- change engine gear up
    - only works if boat is started
    - max gear 5
- change engine gear down
    - only works if boat is started
    - min gear -2
- increase boat speed
    - only works if boat is started
    - if gear is 0, has no effect
    - changes boat speed so that is further away from 0
    - gear 5 increases speed faster than gear 1
    - gear -2 increases speed faster than gear -1
- decrease boat speed
    - only works if boat is started
    - if gear is 0, has no effect
    - changes boat speed so that is closer to 0

Show the current speed of the boat to the user
Show also buttons for the different actions

**BONUS CHALLENGE** Show distance travelled
